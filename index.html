                    Qi means life force energy. Energy is simply potential until it's given a pattern. The 
pattern that you give your energy determines the shape of your life. The YOQI method is 
designed to help you repattern unhealthy patterns of energy and create healthy patterns of 
energy using safe and effective principles from yoga and qigong that you can do right at 
home. Whether you are a beginner, or have experience with yoga and energy arts, YOQI offers 
a range of levels and classes for everyone.
